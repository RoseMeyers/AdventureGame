 Minecraft simulator where player can "mine" blocks, attack them to disappear, and keep track of coordinates in world like in Mojang Studios "Minecraft."
 I made this project alone with the help of instructors from Udemy course. I made this project completely new to Unreal Engine, my only knowledge of Unreal was that developers of Fortnite use it to run the game so I was interested in learning how to use it too. Minecraft is one of my favorite games so I decided to combine my favorite game, with the engine that another of my favorite game runs on. I plan on expanding this project and continuing to work on it because Unreal Engine is extremely interesting to me.
